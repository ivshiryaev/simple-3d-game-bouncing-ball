----------

To play the game, download the repository and open 'OOPSubmission.exe'.

The game consists of four levels and a sandbox mode.

To complete a level, you just have to roll the ball to the end of that level.

Sandbox mode: Random platforms spawn, and you must jump on them to stay alive.<br/>
If you fall to the floor, you will lose.<br/>
Beware of the enemy balls; they will do everything to throw you off the floor.<br/>

Controls:

WASD: move<br/>
Space: jump<br/>
The game was made in Unity, and the scripts were written using C#.
